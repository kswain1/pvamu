Baseball Metrics for Pvamu statistics 


## Goal 
We will be doing basic sabermetrics for the SWAC baseball team of Prairie View A&M Unviersity.


High Level Objectives: 
-  Create a Databank of all SWAC 2017 statistics in the PVAMU Region
- Create a Master Player List with all of data
- Compute Top Players Sabemetrically i.e(wOBA, WAR, etc..)
- Predict the Amount of Wins PVAMU will win this season

## Project 1 Predicting Prairie View A&M Teams
There are two ways to predict the amount of games your team will win. One can do it based on indivual player data or Team Stats from game to game. 

# Team Approach
The thesis for the machine learning predictor will be based on https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/scikit-learn-tutorial-baseball-1. The bottom line in the game of baseball is how many runs you score and how many runs you allow.
#Steps to Accomplish 
1. Load in Prairie View Data 
2. Load in Other Members of the Conference Data
3. Predict how Many Runs PVAMU will score a game 
4. Predict the Total Amount of Wins they will have in the year 2018

# Indivual Player Approach
1. Predict the War for each player
